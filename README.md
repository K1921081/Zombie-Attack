# Zombie-Attack
First-person shooter game created with Unity.

The game features a few menus as well as a few levels. There is a main menu, with options to start playing the game, read the instructions, check the credits or quit. 

There are also three levels, with varying size and each next one showcasing a new zombie type. The regular zombie is the weakest, with low hp and damage. The weapon zombie has very high hp and moderate damage, and the gun zombie has the lowest health of all zombie types, but can kill the player in one hit and also do so from a long distance.
